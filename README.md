# DAG_Blockchain

This is a prototype of blockchain (BC) in python3.6

The system consists of three parts, which are webchain, conchain, and chainbase.

The entity consists of two parts, which are marcoblock miner and microblock miner.

During each block-cycle, macroblock miners execute leadership selection, while microblock miners just execute mining.

To find more details, please wait for our update.

Here is a usage example (just for local test, which 1 microblock miner and 2 marcoblock minersï¼‰

First

Use pip to install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Second

Build lib.so (Pivot Chain selection function, written in C++)
```
g++ main.cpp -fPIC -shared -o lib.so
g++ main.cpp -fPIC -shared -o lib_test.so
g++ main.cpp -fPIC -shared -o lib_test_two.so
```
Third

Run backend Chainbase
```
python DAG_macro_chainbase.py
python DAG_macro_chainbsse_test.py
python DAG_micro_chainbase.py
```
Forth

Run consensus module Conchain
```
python DAG_macro_conchain.py
python DAG_macro_conchain_test.py
python micro_conchain.py
```
Fifth

Run frontend Webchain
```
python webchain.py
python webchain_test.py
python webchin_test_two.py
```
Sixth

Run trans-generator
```
python trans_maker.py
python trans_maker_test.py
python trans_maker_test_two.pu
```
Then the test network is build successfully!

If you want to build a public net version, you should:

First

Start webchain using Gunicorn:

```
pip install gunicorn
```

```
gunicorn --workers=3 webchain:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then, webchain is accessable form port:8000!

Second 

Build lib.so (Pivot Chain selection function, written in C++)
```
g++ main.cpp -fIPC -shared -o lib.so
```
Third

Run backend Chainbase
```
python DAG_macro_chainbase.py
```
Forth

Run consensus module Conchain
```
python DAG_macro_conchain.py
```
Fifth

Run trans-generator
```
python trans_maker.py
```
Then the public network version is build successfully!
